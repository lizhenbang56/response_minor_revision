\noindent Dear Editors:

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you and the reviewers for the insightful and helpful comments. When we revised the paper, we carefully considered and followed all the comments and suggestions provided by you and the reviewers. To summarize, we have made the following revisions:

(1) We have carefully considered and followed all the comments and suggestions related to the clarity of the writing, and made the new material a thoroughly revised manuscript. Specifically, several state-of-the-art anchor-free trackers have been discussed in Section II. The algorithm for the attack process has been added in Section III.C. We have explained in detail the perturbation update process in offline training. We have also added the advantages and limitations of the proposed method after experimental analysis and the future work to the conclusion. The descriptions of figures and tables have been rewritten, and the format of all the tables has been unified.

We hope that our revised manuscript is now appropriate for publication in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology. Specific responses to all the comments of each reviewer are included in the rest of this document and highlighted using bold font after the comments of each reviewer for the convenience of cross-reference. To make the changes easier to identify where necessary, we also have underlined most of the revised parts in the manuscript and provide an underlined version for the convenience of second review.\\[10pt]
\indent We are looking forward to your reply.\\[10pt]

\textit{The authors have now greatly improved understandability and clarity of their manuscript. Some additional experiments are also added to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

\textbf{Many thanks for your positive comments on the strength of our paper and the novelty of the proposed attack method.}

\textit{There are some minor comments: 1. Eq.3 and Eq.5 seem to be the same.}

\textit{2. The section of experiments is a little tedious and some analyses in Sec. IV-D and Sec. IV-G are duplicated. The reviewer suggests that the authors re-organize these forms and contents in experiments.}

\textit{3. Please check the format of the references. Some of them are incompatible with others.}

\textit{4. The reviewer suggests a thorough spell and grammar check that would increase the readability of this MS.}

\textit{- On page 5, 'to cooling down' is a grammar error in line 29.}

\textit{- On page 8, ' FAN generates independent perturbation for each frame' has a grammar error in line 33.}

\textit{- On page 12, 'my result in' is a typo in line 46.}
